## Initial Motivation
In my role as a Strategic Finance Manager, I am regularly tasked with analyzing large datasets to extract actionable insights that influence strategic decisions. This responsibility sparked my interest in not just reviewing, but also in understanding the intricacies of how data visualizations and dashboards are constructed.

I recognized that by deepening my knowledge in this area, I could enhance my ability to not only interpret data dashboards but also to better communicate with data and product management teams. The process of distilling vast amounts of data into concise, actionable visualizations is fascinating to me. It's a skill that adds immense value by enabling clearer communication and more informed decision-making within our finance team and senior leadership.

Therefore, I decided to expand my expertise into the technical realm of data visualization with Power BI, Tableau and SQL. I aim to bridge the gap between raw data management and strategic financial analysis to drive business growth and enhance strategic decision-making.

### Power BI Visualization

## Netflix Shows - Power BI Visualization *Catchy Title about main point of dashboard*
- Motivation: Given my familiarity with Microsoft tools, I recognized that learning Power BI would be a natural and strategic first step in mastering data visualization technologies.

- Steps: 
I used a Netflix dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?phase=FinishSSORegistration&returnUrl=%2Fdatasets%2Fshivamb%2Fnetflix-shows%2Fversions%2F5%3Fresource%3Ddownload&SSORegistrationToken=CfDJ8CYusWan8yNKiDQcrMXOtQHX_djfNG_zLS6iF0VqGUQjSl8SVQHwEprCmuSuv9vzc_5pV93wrT8OK3JQo3tO5GOoL6JVNb681_4zhs526PsO9fbg90Ilst4ACttQXAbflL6vSph0m_Fac8xoeMz0urCmxVSCz9IMZ1Ke-yaF57TAnKCCvBDADrVDhDy-ujv2i7_9DFhwCTF-OonQUPX2es9XcD56A3rxpskjBjxIBuSfHiv7GNuiBPlavPty6Sjk-kaK_Xp3vIHlOG2LxFOHiQ-unPcEU0ThKqxv1IrnWSqlNZS8DCqFJhMXoPoGEE99T8-zFCxRaFripySkpr2N1P9eNw&DisplayName=Grace+Li) because it was interesting and easy to understand.
Next, I refined the dataset on Excel by segregating names and countries into distinct columns, and by eliminating extraneous spaces and commas.
I wanted to use SQL to set up different tables I could upload onto Power BI consolidate the different names and country columns 
Ran into issue with uploading excel to sql workbench and figured out need to replace all blank cells with 'NULL'.
